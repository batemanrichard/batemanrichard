# About me 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modelling the impacts of climate change on Irish Agriculture in order to design/test posible adaptation strategies. The first stage is to model the impacts on grass growth across the Republic of Ireland using the MoSt grass growth model, future weather under different possible climate change scenarios from the Met Eireann TRANSLATE project, and spatial soil data from the Irish Soil Information System.
